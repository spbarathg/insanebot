# Development Workflow

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features

### Supporting Branches
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent production fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

## Development Process

### 1. Starting Work
1. Create a new branch from `develop`
2. Follow branch naming convention:
   - `feature/description`
   - `bugfix/issue-number`
   - `hotfix/description`

### 2. Development
1. Write code following style guide
2. Write tests for new features
3. Update documentation
4. Run linters and tests locally

### 3. Code Review
1. Push changes to remote
2. Create pull request
3. Request reviews from team members
4. Address review comments
5. Ensure CI passes

### 4. Merging
1. Squash commits if needed
2. Merge into `develop`
3. Delete feature branch
4. Update related issues

### 5. Release Process
1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Version bump and changelog
3. Final testing
4. Merge to `main` and `develop`
5. Tag release

## Tools and Automation
