# Performance Tuning Guide

## Optimizing Bot Behavior Under Load

### 1. **RPC Settings**
- Use a high-performance RPC endpoint.
- Adjust `skip_preflight` and `max_retries` based on network conditions.
- Monitor RPC latency and switch endpoints if necessary.

### 2. **Caching**
- Enable caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., token prices, balances).
- Use an LRU cache with appropriate TTL settings.
- Regularly clean up expired cache entries.

### 3. **Batch Processing**
- Group transactions into batches to reduce RPC calls.
- Use `asyncio.gather` for parallel processing.
- Monitor batch size and adjust based on network capacity.

### 4. **Connection Pooling**
- Reuse RPC connections to minimize overhead.
- Implement connection pooling for WebSocket and HTTP clients.

### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**
- Use structured logging for better analysis.
- Monitor key metrics (latency, TPS, error rates) in real-time.
- Set up alerts for performance degradation.

### 6. **Error Handling**
- Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
- Use exponential backoff for retries.

### 7. **Resource Management**
- Monitor memory and CPU usage.
- Optimize event loops and async tasks.
