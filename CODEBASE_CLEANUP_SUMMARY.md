## 🚀 Cleanup Actions Performed

### 1. **Cache & Temporary Files Removed**
- ✅ All `__pycache__` directories removed
- ✅ All `.pyc`, `.pyo`, `.pyd` files removed
- ✅ Test artifacts and temporary files cleaned
- ✅ Empty directories removed (preserving .gitkeep)

### 2. **Dependencies Optimized**
- ✅ Removed development-only dependencies:
  - pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov
  - black, isort, flake8, mypy
  - SQLAlchemy, alembic (optional for production)
  - redis, aioredis (optional caching)
  - pathlib2 (Python 2 compatibility)
- ✅ Kept essential runtime dependencies only
- ✅ Maintained all Solana blockchain dependencies

### 3. **Documentation Streamlined**
- ✅ Removed redundant documentation files
- ✅ Kept single comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Updated .gitignore for better exclusions

## 🔒 Security Audit Results

### ✅ **Security Compliance**
1. **No Hardcoded Secrets:** All API keys, passwords, and private keys use environment variables
2. **Proper Key Management:** Wallet manager implements encryption and secure storage
3. **Environment Variables:** All sensitive data properly externalized
4. **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation throughout the system

### 🔍 **False Positives Resolved**
- Token addresses flagged as "secrets" are actually public blockchain addresses
- All flagged items are legitimate configuration values, not security risks
